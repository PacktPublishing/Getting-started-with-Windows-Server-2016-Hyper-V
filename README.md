## About the Video Course

In this course, we’ll start by getting introduced to Hyper-V and look at the difference between the traditional datacenter and the new modern datacenter. Then you’ll explore Nano Server and how it can be used as a Hyper-V host.
Then you will dive into learning how to upgrade from Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2016. You’ll also learn about exporting and importing virtual machines and migrating, converting, and upgrading different types of virtual and physical machines. 

Further on, you will see how to create and add virtual hard disks, and configure IDE and SCSI controllers, and add Virtual Fiber Channel storage. You’ll find out how to create resource pools, enable and add NIC teaming, create virtual switches using the advanced network settings.

By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the new Hyper-V Windows Server 2016 features that allow you to build more flexible infrastructure with maximum operational efficiency, and increase security and performance.
